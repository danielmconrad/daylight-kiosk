An installer to setup your RaspberryPi as a kiosk to show the [Daylight](https://github.com/danmconrad/daylight) website on a schedule.

## Requirements
To install properly, Raspbian and needed on your Pi. Unfortunately, NOOBS won't do.


## Installation
Clone this repository and run the `install.sh` file.

```
git clone https://github.com/danmconrad/daylight-kiosk.git
cd daylight-kiosk
./install.sh
```

If you'd rather go through the installation manually, follow the directions in the MANUAL.md file in this repo.
